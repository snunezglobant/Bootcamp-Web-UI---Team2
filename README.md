##Groundwork finished

###Revisions of the final version of "Bootcamp WebUI Final Project Team2" (Searchify):





We pushed the app, and:



<ol>

  

<li> Tested the  functionality until it fitted our demands.</li>

<li> Validated the code -every piece of it.</li>  

<li> Improved and finished the style viewing and the routing behaviour.</li>

  

<li> We also use many ng's for validations, iterating the endpoints results and also over object properties of that results, control the routing and the expected getting of that data and finally to make the code clean.</li>



</ol>



Now -March 18, 2015 as we are writing:

  

<ul>
  
  
     <li> 
         We are pushing the app, and still changing details until twelve noon of today
     </li>
     
     <li> We made the templates, corrected, improved the routing behaviour, improved the visual behaviour, improve
          some data issues, and finally uploaded the result
      </li>

</ul>


We made it.
