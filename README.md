##Groundwork finished

###Revisions of the final version of "Bootcamp WebUI Final Project Team2" (Searchify):





We pushed the app, and:



<ol>

  

<li> Tested the  functionality until it fitted our demands.</li>

<li> Validated the code -every piece of it.</li>  

<li> Improved and finished the style viewing and the routing behaviour.</li>

  

<li> We also used many ng's -we might use directives, but we used services and promises inside an app js for clearing the code.</li>



</ol>



Now -March 18, 2015 as we are writing:

  

<ul>
  
  
     <li> 
         We are pushing the app, and still changing details until twelve noon of today
     </li>
     
     <li> We made the templates, corrected, improved the routing behaviour, improved the visual behaviour, improve
          some data issues, and finally uploaded the result
      </li>

</ul>


Update: We made it. Don't tell Justin Bieber yet.
