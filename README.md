##Laying the groundwork for versioning and coding

###Revisions before "Bootcamp WebUI Final Project Team2 version#1"

Before pushing that version, we will list the changes we made:

<ol>

<li> We created the first templates of every requirement, according to the chore.</li>

<li> Then, we improved then, started the style viewing and started the routing behaviour.</li>

<li> We also used many ng services -we might use directives, and even a factory inside an app js for clearing the code.</li>

</ol>

NOW ---March 15, 2015 as we are writing:

<ul>
  <li>
    We are making the revisions of changes in separate branches, in order to not cross references until it was 
    neccesary.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  We will push incrementally, according to our meets, for a review in overall in order to avoid arguing of
  different topics and agree a version of the app.
  </li>
</ul>
