<h2>Laying the groundwork for versioning and coding</h2>

<h3>Revisions before "Bootcamp WebUI Final Project Team2 version#1"</h3>

After pushing that version, we will list the changes we made:

<ol>

<li> We created the first templates of every requirement, according to the chore.</li>

<li> Then, we improved then, started the style viewing and started the routing behaviour.</li>

<li> We also used many ng services, directives and even a factory inside an app js for clearing the code.</li>

</ol>

NOW:

<ul>
  <li>
    We are making the revisions of changes in separate branches, in order to not cross references until it was 
    neccesary.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  We will push incrementally, according to our meets, for a review in overall in order to avoid arguing of
  different topics and agree a version of the app.
  </li>
</ul>
