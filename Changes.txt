Revisions of the week before "Bootcamp WebUI Final Project Team2 version#1"

After pushing that version, we will list the changes we made:

- We created the first templates of every requirement, according to the chore.

- Then, we improved then, started the style viewing and started the routing behaviour.

- We also used many ng services, directives and even a factory inside an app js for clearing the code.


NOW:


- Now, we are making the revisions of changes in separate branches, in order to not cross references until it was 
neccesary.

- We will push incrementally, according to our meets, for a review in overall in order to avoid arguing of
different topics and agree a version of the app.
